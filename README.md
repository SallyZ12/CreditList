#CreditList

To use this app, clone from Github, cd into the directory credit-list, run bundle install, then shotgun.

This app allows a User to maintain a list of credits in their portfolio with their associated transactions(s).

The first time a credit is created a transaction must be created at that time.

However, that transaction can subsequently be deleted from the credit and the credit remains in the database.
